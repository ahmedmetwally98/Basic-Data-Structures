# Static Implementation of Basic Data Structure in C Language

## Basic Data Structures are:
>- List
>- Queue
>- Stack


- Each data structure consists of *source* and *header* files.
- Header file declares the data structure and declares the public interfaces.
- Source file implements the public interfaces.
- User has to configure the **size** ,since this is a static implementation, and the **element type** of the data structure from the header file.
